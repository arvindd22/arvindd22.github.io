## Research Work Experience

### Automated Data Extraction from Research Articles | Summer Project 
[Project Work](github.com/arvindd22/Automated-Data-Extraction-from-Research-Articles)

May 2024 – July 2024

Mentor: Prof. Shivam Tripathi | Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur

##### Objective
To retrieve research articles containing domain-specific keywords and graph plots using an automated tool.
Identify the graph plots, X–Y axis labels, and the embedded text from images contained in the articles.

##### Approach:
Scraped over 5000 research articles in XML format using elementtree and requests for text and image collection.
Extracted text and X–Y axis labels from images using pytesseract, and classified articles based on keywords.
Trained a YOLOv8 object detection model on 1000+ annotated graphs to accurately identify graphs in images.

##### Outcome:
Achieved an accuracy score of 0.95 in graph detection and an F1 score of 0.86 using the trained YOLOv8 model.
Obtained 0.90 and 0.94 accuracy scores for identifying X-axis and Y-axis labels respectively.
Successfully developed a tool to automate and accelerate research by streamlining information extraction.

## Projects
### Bayesian Analysis and Inference
[Project work](https://github.com/arvindd22/Bayesian-Analysis-and-Inference)

Stamatics IIT Kanpur Project

##### Objective
• To build probabilistic programming models using Bayesian Statistics to capture complex relations in data

##### Approach
• Utilized ArviZ for effective posterior visualization, predictive checks and for diagnostics of Bayesian models • Utilized PyMC3 for hierarchical models, expanded linear regression analysis techniques on complex data • Explored model averaging, modeling using Bambi, and interoperability with variable selection techniques


### Introduction To Machine Learning
[Project work](https://github.com/arvindd22/Intro-to-ML)

Objective
• To implement standard Machine Learning models and study theoretical concepts and their practical applications

Approach
• Developed a Polynomial regression model from scratch using only Numpy & Pandas libraries in python • Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree regressor using sklearn library, got an accuracy of 0.77 • Build a 3-layer Artificial Neural Network, utilising the Backpropagation algorithm and sigmoid function

Outcome
• Executed the Artificial Neural Network on the data set and obtained an accuracy of 0.83 on test data
