[Project Work](github.com/arvindd22/Automated-Data-Extraction-from-Research-Articles)

Mentor: Prof. Shivam Tripathi | Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur 
May 2024 – July 2024

##### Objective
To retrieve research articles containing domain-specific keywords and graph plots using an automated tool.
Identify the graph plots, X–Y axis labels, and the embedded text from images contained in the articles.

##### Approach
Scraped over 5000 research articles in XML format using elementtree and requests for text and image collection.
Extracted text and X–Y axis labels from images using pytesseract, and classified articles based on keywords.
Trained a YOLOv8 object detection model on 1000+ annotated graphs to accurately identify graphs in images.

##### Outcome
Achieved an accuracy score of 0.95 in graph detection and an F1 score of 0.86 using the trained YOLOv8 model.
Obtained 0.90 and 0.94 accuracy scores for identifying X-axis and Y-axis labels respectively.
Successfully developed a tool to automate and accelerate research by streamlining information extraction.
