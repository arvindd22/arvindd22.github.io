## Projects
### Bayesian Analysis and Inference
[Project work](https://github.com/arvindd22/Bayesian-Analysis-and-Inference)
Stamatics IIT Kanpur Project
Objective
• To build probabilistic programming models using Bayesian Statistics to capture complex relations in data

Approach
• Utilized ArviZ for effective posterior visualization, predictive checks and for diagnostics of Bayesian models • Utilized PyMC3 for hierarchical models, expanded linear regression analysis techniques on complex data • Explored model averaging, modeling using Bambi, and interoperability with variable selection techniques


### Introduction To Machine Learning
[Project work](https://github.com/arvindd22/Intro-to-ML)

Objective
• To implement standard Machine Learning models and study theoretical concepts and their practical applications

Approach
• Developed a Polynomial regression model from scratch using only Numpy & Pandas libraries in python • Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree regressor using sklearn library, got an accuracy of 0.77 • Build a 3-layer Artificial Neural Network, utilising the Backpropagation algorithm and sigmoid function

Outcome
• Executed the Artificial Neural Network on the data set and obtained an accuracy of 0.83 on test data
